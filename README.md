This app allows you to install and run a Node-RED server using [Snap4City](https://www.snap4city.org/) on your Android device. This installation includes a set of nodes that allow you to interact with the Android device sensors and actuators, alongside all of the nodes of [```node-red-contrib-snap4city-developer```](https://github.com/disit/node-red-contrib-snap4city-developer) and [```node-red-contrib-snap4city-user```](https://github.com/disit/node-red-contrib-snap4city-user).

This is a fork of the original Termux app and you can identify all the modifications to the original codebase just by searching 'MERGE' project-wide.
